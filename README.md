# ARM-based Smart Channel Switching System

## Project Overview
The **ARM-based Smart Channel Switching System** is an advanced embedded systems project designed to demonstrate real-time processing and efficient channel management using ARM architecture. The system leverages ARM's powerful interrupt handling capabilities to manage multiple channels dynamically, ensuring seamless switching and optimal performance. This project is ideal for applications in communication systems, IoT devices, and real-time embedded systems.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Channel Switching**: Utilizes ARM's Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) for efficient handling of real-time interrupts, enabling smooth and dynamic channel switching.
- **Direct Memory Access (DMA)**: Implements DMA for high-speed data transfer between peripherals and memory, reducing CPU overhead and improving system performance.
- **SPI Communication**: Uses Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) for fast and reliable communication between the ARM microcontroller and external devices.
- **TFT Display Integration**: Incorporates a Thin-Film Transistor (TFT) display to provide real-time visual feedback of the selected channel and system status.
- **LED Matrix for Data Transmission**: Employs an LED matrix for both transmitting and receiving channel data, showcasing the system's ability to handle bidirectional communication.
- **System Tick Timer (STK)**: Utilizes the ARM System Tick Timer for precise timing control, ensuring accurate channel switching intervals.

## Technologies Used
- **Microcontroller**: ARM Cortex-M series (e.g., STM32, LPC1768)
- **Programming Language**: Embedded C
- **Communication Protocols**: SPI, I2C, UART
- **Peripherals**: TFT Display, LED Matrix, GPIO, DMA, NVIC, RCC (Reset and Clock Control)
- **Development Tools**: Keil uVision, STM32CubeMX, Proteus for simulation

## How It Works
1. **Channel Detection**: The system continuously monitors incoming data streams from multiple channels using GPIO and SPI.
2. **Interrupt Handling**: When a new channel is detected, the NVIC triggers an interrupt, allowing the system to prioritize and switch to the new channel in real time.
3. **Data Transfer**: DMA is used to transfer channel data directly to memory, minimizing CPU intervention and ensuring high-speed data processing.
4. **Display Feedback**: The selected channel and system status are displayed on the TFT screen, providing real-time visual feedback to the user.
5. **LED Matrix Communication**: The LED matrix is used to transmit and receive channel data, demonstrating the system's ability to handle bidirectional communication efficiently.

## Applications
- **Communication Systems**: Ideal for managing multiple communication channels in real-time systems.
- **IoT Devices**: Can be used in IoT devices that require dynamic channel switching and efficient data handling.
- **Embedded Systems**: Suitable for embedded systems that need precise timing and interrupt handling.
